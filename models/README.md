# Demo Models

Curated model fixtures and generator assets for text-to-cad workflows.

This tree is intended to be committed with Git LFS for large CAD, mesh, and
robot artifacts. Source generators and concise documentation remain normal
text files.

**Where does a new model go?** If it is one self-contained `<name>.step.py`
file, it belongs in `step/parts/` (single body) or `step/assemblies/`
(multi-part). If it needs a folder of its own — helper modules, per-link
generators, research/provenance docs, a `render/` config — it belongs in
`renders/`. Robot fixtures imported from elsewhere go in `robots/`.

Generated output (`__irincad__/`, `.step` exports) is written on demand beside
the sources and is gitignored — never commit it.

## Directory Map

- `step/`: STEP generator sources, split by shape:
  - [step/parts/](step/parts/README.md): single-body `<name>.step.py`
    generators — structured fixtures, compact build123d examples, and other
    standalone demo parts.
  - [step/assemblies/](step/assemblies/README.md): flat multi-part
    `<name>.step.py` generators — one-shot concepts and standalone demo
    assemblies, each a single file plus an optional `.params.js` sidecar.
  - [step/mechanisms/](step/mechanisms/README.md): flattened, imported
    mechanism STEP demos and their viewer sidecars.
  - `models/renders/` and `models/robots/` (below) are the only other places
    STEP files belong — both keep STEP sources inside self-contained project
    folders.
- [renders/](renders/README.md): large concept renders and related
  experiments — every model that needs a folder of its own rather than a flat
  generator file. All 12: the educational public-source SpaceX reconstruction
  packages (`raptor2`, `merlin1d`, `falcon_heavy`, `starship`), the `f1`,
  `hypercar`, `moonwatch`, `qdd_actuator`, `raptor3` and `starship-mechazilla`
  concept packages, and the `juno`/`lyra` robot description packages.
- [mesh/](mesh/README.md): exported `stl/`, `3mf/`, and `glb/` mesh artifacts —
  durable exports from `step/parts/` and `step/assemblies/` kept as fixtures
  for testing export/render behavior, organized by format.
- [implicits/](implicits/README.md): browser-native implicit CAD examples.
- [drawings/dxf/](drawings/dxf/README.md): small 2D DXF fixtures — Python
  `gen_dxf()` generator examples and imported permissively licensed `.dxf`
  files for tooling robustness tests.
- [robots/](robots/README.md): imported robot fixtures with URDF/SRDF — each
  keeps its own mix of STEP, mesh, and other file types alongside the robot
  description rather than splitting across the buckets above. (The authored
  juno/lyra robot description packages live in `renders/` with the other
  concept packages.)

The larger `mechbench/` and `mechbench2/` external datasets are intentionally
not included in this committed fixture tree.

## Git LFS Fetching

Repository LFS config excludes `models/**` from default LFS fetches so ordinary
checkout and publish jobs can avoid downloading every model blob. Fetch the
model artifacts explicitly when you need local bytes:

```bash
git lfs pull --include="models/**" --exclude=""
```

## Cleanup Policy

- Keep canonical sources (`*.py`, `*.implicit.js`, `*.urdf`, `*.srdf`, and docs)
  readable in normal Git.
- Keep durable generated fixtures (`*.step`, `*.stl`, `*.3mf`, `*.glb`, and
  `*.dxf`) in Git LFS.
- Do not commit supplementary media or sidecar metadata such as `*.png`,
  `*.mp4`, `*.gif`, or `*.json` unless a future workflow defines them as a
  required model artifact — a package's `render/` job/theme JSON configs
  (e.g. `renders/moonwatch/render/`) are the established exception.
- Do not commit local runtime debris such as `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`,
  `.cache/`, logs, or one-off timestamped review snapshots.
- Put temporary scratch artifacts under ignored local paths, not in this tree.
