# Deliberately NOT named `.step.py`. The viewer's catalog scanner treats that suffix as a
# STEP entry, which put a solid model in a drawings folder and invited a name collision
# with the sibling `clamp_plate.dxf.py`. This is a helper module the drawing generator
# path-loads, not a model in its own right.
# Prompt: Flat clamp plate with rounded corners, two clamping bolt holes, and
# a central adjustment slot.
