// Viewer-time presentation only: rigid translations away from the baked rest
// pose, plus an opacity ramp on the skin. No geometry lives here.
//
// WHY THE SKIN FADES RATHER THAN JUST MOVING. The airframe is one lofted solid
// (f14_parts/body.py) and it encloses everything worth looking at -- cockpit
// tub, inlet ducts, engine bays, gear wells. Translate it far enough to clear
// the internals and the aircraft stops reading as an aircraft; leave it opaque
// and close and it hides them. So it does both, gently: lifts up and forward
// while dropping to ~22% opacity, which keeps the Tomcat silhouette overhead as
// context while the systems fan out underneath it.
//
// WHY THE STAGES OVERLAP. Everything moving on the same 0..1 ramp reads as one
// object inflating. Each system instead gets its own window inside the ramp, so
// the skin is already lifting before the cockpit follows, and the details land
// last -- the eye gets a sequence to follow instead of a single pop. The
// windows overlap on purpose: strict succession looks mechanical, and at 8 s a
// fully serial teardown gives each system under a second of travel.

// stops softly.

// TWO ACTS ON ONE PARAMETER. Act 1 separates the ten systems; act 2 breaks the
// wings and the aft section down into their own parts. Both are driven by the
// single `exploded` ramp rather than a second parameter, because a GIF sweep is
// linear over ONE parameter -- two parameters would sweep simultaneously, not in
// sequence, and the second act would happen during the first.
//
