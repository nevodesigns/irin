"""Grumman F-14D Super Tomcat -- full assembly.

Wings at 20 degrees, canopy closed, gear down, on the deck.  Clean airframe:
empty pylon stations, no external stores.

The airframe skin is ONE lofted solid (``f14_parts/body.py``) built from
full-width blended sections, so the glove flows into the forward fuselage, the
nacelles flow into the pancake tunnel, and the fin roots sit on a continuous
surface.  Nothing in the primary surface is filleted, because nothing there is
joined.

Assembly tree is grouped BY SYSTEM, which is also how the explode parameter
moves things.

OCCURRENCE ORDER IS BY WHAT ACTUALLY BUILDS, not by the SYSTEMS list below.
A system that is missing or that raises is skipped rather than failing the
aircraft, so it takes no occurrence number and everything after it shifts up.
Three of the thirteen produce no group today -- ``glove``, ``engines`` and
``markings`` have no module yet -- so the built aircraft is these ten, and
``f14d.params.js`` refs are numbered against them:

    o1.1  airframe    the one-piece blended skin, cut and detailed
    o1.2  cockpit     tub, panels, seats, HUD, canopy, windscreen
    o1.3  wings       panels, slats, flaps, spoilers, tip lights
    o1.4  inlets      ramps, splitters, bleed slots, ducts
    o1.5  nozzles     C-D nozzles, petals, seals, actuator rings
    o1.6  empennage   fins, rudders, stabilators, ventral fins
    o1.7  aft         speed brakes, beavertail, tailhook, dump mast
    o1.8  nose_gear   leg, wheels, launch bar, doors, bay
    o1.9  main_gear   legs, wheels, brakes, doors, bays
    o1.10 details     antennas, probes, lights, wicks, vents, panels

    (no group: glove, engines, markings -- no module)

Adding any missing module RENUMBERS every occurrence after it, so
``f14d.params.js`` has to be renumbered in the same commit.  ``nozzles`` is the
worked example: it silently dropped out of the aircraft for a while because its
revolve raised ``TopoDS::Solid``, and restoring it moved five systems by one.

# completing; the 3 structural cutters (diverter slot, cockpit opening) cost
