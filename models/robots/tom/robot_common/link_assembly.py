"""Re-express a link's flat instance placements as an AssemblyHelper sub-assembly.

A tom link is currently a flat list of ``{path, name, transform}`` instances. This
helper rebuilds the same geometry as an AssemblyHelper ``Compound`` whose parts are
connected by explicit rigid mates (a root part, with every other part rigid-mated at
its transform relative to the root) instead of independent baked transforms. Geometry
is identical to placing the instances directly; parts import through the cached
``__irincad__`` loader. This is the design-coordinate joint approach (juno-style):
the mate frames carry the design placement, validated against the imported topology.
