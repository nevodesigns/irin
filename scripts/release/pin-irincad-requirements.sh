# Rewrite every `--editable <path>/packages/irincad` requirement to
# `irincad==<VERSION>` so published skills resolve irincad from PyPI.
#
# A source checkout installs irincad editable through the development symlinks,
# which only resolves because `packages/irincad` sits beside the skill. An
# installed skill has no such sibling, so the published tree must name the PyPI
# release instead. The vendored package copy stays in the bundle as an offline
# fallback (`pip install ./<path>/packages/irincad`).
#
# This is a PUBLISH-TREE transformation, run by the Release workflow between
# `bundle.sh --clean` and the publish commit — the same place `models/` is
# removed. It deliberately does NOT live in bundle.sh: that also runs `--check`
# against a development checkout, where rewriting the checked-in requirements
# would dirty the source tree and break the freshness check.
#
# Before the plugin package moved to the repo root, this ran inside
# bundle-plugin.sh over the generated `plugins/cad/skills` copy. There is no
# copy any more — `skills/` is what ships — so it runs over the tree in place.
#
# Usage: scripts/release/pin-irincad-requirements.sh [--check]
#   --check  report what would change and exit 1 if anything would, without writing.
