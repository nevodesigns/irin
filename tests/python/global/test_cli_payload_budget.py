"""stdout is an agent's context window, so payload size is a feature with a budget.

Almost every CLI output here is O(1) -- `gen` prints the same ~100 bytes for a 600-part
assembly that it prints for a single part. The parts inventory from `snapshot --mode list`
is the one exception: it grows with the model, and on a 600-part assembly it was 294 KB
(~73k tokens) of which most was redundancy -- `id`, `occurrenceId` and `ref` were the same
string three times over, `label` duplicated `name`, coordinates carried 16 significant
figures for a dimension in millimetres, and the whole thing was pretty-printed.

These tests measure the shape rather than the bytes of a real render, so they run without a
browser: what a part is allowed to carry, and how a payload is serialised.
