"""Every skill that ships irincad's JS-backed producers must also ship its Node builders.

irincad builds the DXF and implicit render packages by spawning a Node child
(``irincad._internal.node_runtime``), and it looks for that child at
``node_package_root()/cadjs/bin/<name>`` -- the ``packages/`` directory irincad itself was
loaded from. In the dev checkout that is the real ``packages/cadjs/bin``; in a published
skill it is ``skills/<skill>/scripts/packages/cadjs/bin``, which only exists because
``scripts/bundle/skills/bundle-{dxf,implicit-cad}.sh`` esbuilds it there.

This test is the regression guard for the failure those bundle steps fix: a skill runtime
that vendored ``irincad`` but not its builder shipped a format it could not build, and said so
only at build time, in the user's model directory. It asserts what a published skill needs
and cannot get any other way -- the file is present, is a REAL file (a symlink would be
dropped silently by Codex's plugin installer; see ``check-builds.sh``), and is
self-contained: no bare specifier survives that would need a ``node_modules`` the published
tree does not have.
