"""``--output`` and ``SOURCE=OUTPUT`` take a path on the USER'S disk, in their own notation.

`_resolve_cli_output_path` rejected any value containing a backslash, absolutely. On POSIX
that is a useful guard: a backslash is a legal filename character there, so a Windows-shaped
path typed on a Linux box would otherwise create a file literally named ``C:\\out.step``
instead of failing. On Windows it is the opposite of useful -- backslash IS the separator, and
``str(Path(...))`` produces one -- so every native path a Windows user could give the CLI was
refused. Found by the Windows CI job on its first run, in
``test_package_portability.setUpClass``.

The identically worded rule in :mod:`irincad.metadata` is absolute ON PURPOSE and is asserted
here too, so a later change cannot "consistently" relax both. That one validates a path
written into a checked-in ``gen_step()`` envelope, which is read on every platform; POSIX
separators are the portable form for a file in the repository. These are two different rules
that happen to share a sentence.
