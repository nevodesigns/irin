        Locking byte 0 of the sentinel made it unreadable to every other process for the whole
        build -- the Node child's readFileSync got EBUSY, its catch turned that into an empty
        string, and the run-id comparison failed against a sentinel holding exactly the right
        run id. Python's own read_run_id broke the same way.

        Mandatory locking cannot be emulated on POSIX: the fake tracks which files are locked,
        it cannot make a real read fail. So this asserts the INVARIANT that prevents the bug --
        the sentinel is never among the locked files -- by checking the fake's own ledger
        against both inodes, rather than pretending a successful read here proves anything.
