"""A ``__irincad__`` package must survive being moved.

The cache lives beside the source it describes, so it travels with the project: folders get
renamed, copied to another machine, archived, or vendored into another repository. Nothing
about a package's identity is its location -- currency is content hashes, components are
content-addressed, and every recorded path is relative to the model folder -- so a move
should be a no-op and a rebuild should not happen.

That is a design invariant with almost no enforcement. ONE ``relative_to_cwd()`` in a
descriptor writer, or one ``str(path.resolve())``, would bake the builder's directory into
the cache, and nothing would say so: the package still validates on the machine that wrote
it. It surfaces later, as a silent full rebuild after a move, or as a stale-artifact error
in the viewer on a colleague's checkout -- with the descriptor's own recorded path pointing
at a directory that only ever existed somewhere else.

So this asserts both halves, per package kind:

* no file in the package mentions where it was built -- checked over BYTES, because the
  component GLBs and the topology manifests inside them are not text;
* after moving and after renaming, every producer still reports the package current and the
  viewer's freshness validator still accepts it.
